|   March 7  |   (https://github.com/ossd-sp22/searchionary/pull/2/files)  |   add-on-project  | I created a pull request to add a potential feature to Searchionary. I made a small change to one of the files. The change essentially creates a completely new window, with only the main page and definition instead of opening a new tab and redirecting to Merriam Webster. I will likely continue working on this, as I think it would be cool to implement a version that scrapes the new tab for just the definition, and prints the definition right below the Searchionary popup, without opening a new tab or window at all.    |
