| Feb 3   | link to my contribution    | course website    |   I fixed a broken link.    |
|   March 7  |   (https://github.com/ossd-sp22/searchionary/pull/2/files)  |   add-on-project  | I created a pull request to add a potential feature to Searchionary. I made a small change to one of the files. The change essentially creates a completely new window, with only the main page and definition instead of opening a new tab and redirecting to Merriam Webster. I will likely continue working on this, as I think it would be cool to implement a version that scrapes the new tab for just the definition, and prints the definition right below the Searchionary popup, without opening a new tab or window at all.    |
|   March 21 |   (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Deerfield_High_School_(Illinois)&diff=1078536755&oldid=1072244546)  |  Updated Academic achievement info  | The site had info from 2012. I updated the info to reflect more recent academic achievements, from 2018-2019.  |
|   April 1 |   (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SpaceX&diff=prev&oldid=1080563740)  |  Updated Information about Starlink satellites  | The site previously had information about starlink satellites from 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021. I read an article about SpaceX launching 48 more Starlink satellites into orbit on march 9th, and added some information about this to the wikipedia page. |
|   April 18 |   (https://github.com/ossd-sp22/study-timer/pull/1/commits/c9ef72350433b5dfa2c43476f66195ea38b67cc7)  |  Quick addition to Study Timer  | Previously, if the user didn't input 3 numbers for h : m : s, the timer wouldn't work at all. Now, if the user puts in only 1 or 2 numbers, it will still run assuming the inputs are minutes and seconds if the user enters 2 numbers or just seconds if the user only enters 1. Currently awaiting pull request acceptance. 
|   April 24 |   (https://github.com/ossd-sp22/study-timer/pull/2/commits/0c2f3e59943345331617d6abb84428080f5bc890)  |  Added Sound Options to Study Timer | Added 3 buttons to the bottom of the popup that give the user options for what sound they want to hear when the timer gets down to 0.
